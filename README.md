Software and instructions for improving the PMC 101 Micromate Z80-CP/M3 personal computer (1983)

I bought a Micromate PMC 101 computer in 1983. Turns out it still works. Actually, it's a great machine. But one floppy (400kB) is very limiting. And more capacity is cheap and easily available. Here's what I did to add an IDE-based CF/SD-card to the machine.

If you own a Micromate, you can do it too.

Stay tuned for more.
